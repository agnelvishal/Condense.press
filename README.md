Unique Feature of the search engine.
===========================

In this search engine, one can sort webpages by user-defined ranking factors. For example, the user can increase the ranking for webpages with images. One can even select unstoppable domains which have gundb chat enabled.

This way, every user can set their own ranking algorithm instead of Google deciding the ranking algorithm for the whole world. This will stop data manipulation by monopolies and promote decentralization.


A better way to pick news articles.
===========================

News apps like Google News, Flipboard, BBC, Inshorts show trending articles written a day or two back. If say there are hundred articles written in a day, these news apps pick just a few of them. It is a time saving feature. But they lack a key flexibility.

Consider you havenâ€™t read any news for the last 1 month or 1 year. If you open any of the news apps or news websites, you will still be shown trending articles written a day or two back and not last month or last year.

Hence I and my friends(Domnic Amalan, Deepak, Rejo) have created https://www.condense.press. It picks popular articles of a website in a time range we specify.

For example, techcrunch.com has 292,172 articles. But https://www.condense.press sorts all those articles based on popularity.
